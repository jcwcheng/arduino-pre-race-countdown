# Pre-race Countdown
Pre-race countdown before the start of an event

After pressing down the tactile switch, the LCD shows "Are you ready for race day? :D"
The neopixel strip simultaneously diffuses blue light to grab participants attention. The neopixel strip then starts the countdown every 5 sec from red, yellow to green to inform participants when to go. The LCD in place displays "Ready", "Get set" and "Go" accordingly.
